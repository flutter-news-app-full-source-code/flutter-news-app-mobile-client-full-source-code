# Active Context

## Current Focus

Implementing remaining features.

## Recent Changes

- Updated the search page to use shared widgets for initial, loading, and error states.
- Simplified the search bar by integrating it directly into the AppBar.
- Added a search button to the AppBar to trigger the search.
- Refactored the headlines search feature to support infinite scrolling.

## Next Steps

-   Implement the planned features and integrate the backend (Firebase, with future Supabase support).

## Active Decisions

-   The directory structure is organized by feature, not module.
-   The project follows a page/view pattern for UI components.
