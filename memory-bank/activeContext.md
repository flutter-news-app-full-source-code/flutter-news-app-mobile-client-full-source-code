# Active Context

## Current Focus

Updating the memory bank to reflect the addition of the headlines search feature and associated route updates.

## Recent Changes

- Added the `headlines-search` feature:
    - Created `headlines-search/bloc/headlines_search_bloc.dart`, `headlines_search_event.dart`, and `headlines_search_state.dart`.
    - Created `headlines-search/view/headlines_search_page.dart` and `headlines_search_view.dart`.
- Updated the router (`lib/router/router.dart` and `lib/router/routes.dart`) to include the search route.

## Next Steps

-   Continue updating the memory bank.

## Active Decisions

-   The directory structure is organized by feature, not module.
-   The project follows a page/view pattern for UI components.
