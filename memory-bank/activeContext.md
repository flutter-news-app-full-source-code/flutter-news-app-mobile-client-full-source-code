# Active Context

## Current Focus

Initializing the memory bank. This involves creating the core files and populating them with information gathered from the existing project structure and code.

## Recent Changes

-   Created `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md`.
-   Corrected the description of the directory structure in `systemPatterns.md` to reflect feature-based organization.
-   Analyzed the `headlines-feed` feature and identified the page/view pattern.
-   Updated `systemPatterns.md` to document the page/view pattern.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the memory bank with information about the layered architecture.
- Updated the memory bank with information about barrel files.
- Updated `.clinerules` with the convention to document no-op operations.
- Updated `.clinerules` with error handling best practices.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored the router (`lib/router/router.dart` and `lib/router/routes.dart`):
  - Added `name` parameters to `GoRoute` definitions for named navigation.
  - Added an example sub-route (`article/:id`) to demonstrate detail page routing.
  - Updated the `Routes` class to include name constants.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions

-   The directory structure is organized by feature, not module.
-   The project follows a page/view pattern for UI components.
