# Product Context

## Problem

Users need a way to stay informed about current events through a concise and easily accessible news headlines feed. Existing solutions might be cluttered, overwhelming, or lack personalization options.

## Solution

This Flutter application aims to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for browsing news headlines. It leverages a clean UI, efficient data handling, and a layered architecture to deliver relevant information quickly and ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Clarity:** Headlines should be presented in a clear and readable format.
-   **Efficiency:** The app should load quickly and respond smoothly to user interactions.
-   **Simplicity:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
-   **Potentially:** Offer filtering or customization options to tailor the feed to user preferences.

## How it Should Work (Inferred)

1.  The app fetches headlines from a data source (likely an API, based on the use of `HtInMemoryHeadlinesClient` and `HtHeadlinesRepository`).
2.  Headlines are displayed in a list or similar format.
3.  Users can potentially interact with headlines (e.g., tap to view full articles, though this is not yet confirmed by the provided code).
4.  The app may offer filtering options to refine the displayed headlines.
