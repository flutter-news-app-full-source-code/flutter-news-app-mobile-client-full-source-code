# Progress

## What Works

-   Multiple environment configurations (development, staging, production) using `main_*.dart` files.
-   BLoC pattern implementation for state management.
-   Repository pattern for data access.
-   Initial Memory Bank setup.
- Router refactoring with named navigation and example sub-route.
-   `headlines-feed` feature:
    -   `HeadlinesFeedBloc` for managing headlines data and filtering.
    -   `HeadlinesFeedPage` and `_HeadlinesFeedView` for displaying headlines.
    -   `_HeadlinesFilterBottomSheet` for applying filters.
    - Infinite scroll functionality.
    - Refresh functionality.
-   `headlines-search` feature:
    -   `HeadlinesSearchBloc` for managing headlines search.
    -   `HeadlinesSearchPage` and `HeadlinesSearchView` for displaying search results.
    -   Routing for the search feature.

## What's Left to Build

-   Integration with a real headlines API (currently using an in-memory client).
-   Full implementation of filtering functionality (UI is present, but API integration may be needed).
-   Navigation and routing (basic setup exists, named navigation implemented, sub-routes need further implementation based on application needs).
-   Error handling and potentially loading states (basic widgets exist, but more robust handling may be needed).
-   Testing.

## Current Status

-   Early development stage. Core architecture and the main `headlines-feed` and `headlines-search` features have basic implementations, but many features and refinements are still needed. The memory bank has been updated with information about the layered architecture, barrel files, the convention to document no-op operations, and error handling best practices.

## Known Issues

-   None identified yet, based on the limited code provided.
