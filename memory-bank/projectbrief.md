# Project Brief

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application, likely a news headlines app, based on the directory structure and file names (e.g., `headlines-feed`). It utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management and has different entry points for development, staging, and production environments.

## Goals

-   Provide a functional and user-friendly application for displaying news headlines.
-   Implement a clean and maintainable architecture using Flutter and BLoC. The project uses a layered architecture as described in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
-   Support multiple environments (development, staging, production).

## Key Features (Inferred)

-   Displaying a feed of headlines.
-   Searching headlines.
-   Potentially filtering headlines (based on `headline_filter.dart`).
-   Navigation between different screens/sections (based on `router/`).
